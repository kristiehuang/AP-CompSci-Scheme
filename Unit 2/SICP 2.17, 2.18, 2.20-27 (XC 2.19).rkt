;Louis Reasoner has accidentally switched the way he uses cdr and car
;'(1 4 5 2)
;(cons (square-list (4 5 2)) 1 --> (square-list (5 2)     (16 1)
;he is working in reverse order, so therefore it returns the list backwards

;map acts on each of the elements in the list to return a modified variable, these variables are conned into a list that can be used again
;for-each acts on each of the elements in the list to return a modified variable; these variables are used to perform an action
